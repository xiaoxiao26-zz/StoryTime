(The backend for) an interactive iOS app combining running with spontaneity. Start running the app as you start your physical run, and find yourself in the middle of a mystery story that your app reads to you. Yet the environment of this story is oddly familiar. The characters are speaking in terms of places close to you! To hear the next part of the story, you must travel to one of the locations mentioned by the characters. The way the story unfolds depends on which location you pick. And each time you use this app, the locations are randomized, as are parts of the story, leaving you with a new adventure every time.
